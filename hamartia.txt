activities seem good but you learn it's not actually right

interpersonal relationships

you're a robot dog, trusting of your masters and they tell you they're testing you but they're actually setting you up to fail and they're testing their trap systems

flaw is that you're very trusting and loyal, but they are actually using you as a disposable robot to test traps

more and more dead robots as you get along

they set you up to do a test which will kill you if you do the obvious route, grumpy if you ``pass'' the test.
